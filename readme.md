# Assessment 3

## Background
For this assessment I wanted to make an overview of the population from the Netherlands. I wanted to show some detailed information about marital status, by sex and ages in a nice interactive infographic. But... I haven't succeeded yet.

## The dataset
The data I used is taken from the website [cbs.nl](http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/publication/?DM=SLEN&PA=37296eng&D1=a&D2=0,10,20,30,40,50,60,(l-1,l&LA=EN&HDR=G1&STB=T&VW=T) and shows us how you can categorize our population in the Netherlands. It shows de population of males and females, marital status, by age and more.

### How I used it so far
I downloaded it as a ```.csv``` file en requested it via d3. At first I started to import it with the d3 function ```d3.csv()``` but that didn't gave me what I wanted. So I seeked for help and did get that from [Jens Orsel](https://github.com/jensorsel). He dealt with cleaning data from CBS before and showed me his [example](https://github.com/JensOrsel/fe3-assessment-2/blob/master/index.js). That example showed me that I could request the data by format it as text and clean it allong the way. That brought me further in the proces but not far enough to finish my project in time. 

## So there are still things to do

- [ ] Break up the data so I can use the right data for the right graph
- [ ] Find some graphs that make sense of the data
- [ ] Make a unique design for all of the data and the graphs so it would look like a infographic
- [ ] Make it interactive so people can do something with it.
